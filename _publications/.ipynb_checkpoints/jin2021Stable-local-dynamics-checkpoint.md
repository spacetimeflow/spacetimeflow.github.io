Highlights:
- Present a new dynamical system with local shifting of departure times.
- Establish the asymmetrical upper bounds of the deferral and advance coefficients.
- Derive the continuous version as a kinematic wave model.
- Prove the stability of the user equilibrium with Lyapunov's second method.
- Verify the analytical results with numerical examples.
- Provide guidelines for the derivation of new day-to-day dynamical system models.
